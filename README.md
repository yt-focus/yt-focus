## About The Project
What inspired the creation of this project was during my winter break where I was trying to get some extra studying in. When I went to YouTube I made it a habit to not look at my recommendation feed, and I would sometimes put my hand over it. I did this because I knew I would get distracted, and I would. Even with that habit, sometimes I'm tying, and then boom, out of the corner of my eye something so wild and absurd catches my interest, or I try my hardest to stay focused typing I forget what I was typing.

So I spent tha last week of my break learning how to create a chorme extension and grinded all the way through until I finished. I wanted to be done before school started, so I wouldn't have to think about it anymore, and so that I could use it.

## Contributing
Before contributing there's some things you might wanna know. The basic structure:
- Most of the code is in `background.js` and `popup.js`.
- Messages from the chrome API wasn't working for me, so the basic flow goes as follows:
  - `popup.js` sets listeners on all the elements in `popup.html`
  - user makes an input
  - that input is saved in the chrome storage API
  - `background.js` listens for storage change
  - `background.js` makes runs code to apply styles
- styles are applied with `chrome.scripting.insertCSS` throughout `background.js`. You can see the main code for that at the top of `background.js` under the function `getStyles()`.
- there are two listeners in `background.js`, one for storage change and one for when the page changes (url).
A lot of refactoring can be done. This was my first chrome extension and I'm open to learn from others.
